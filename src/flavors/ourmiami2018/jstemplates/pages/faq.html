<h1>2018 Our Miami Public Space Challenge FAQs</h1>

<dl class="faq">
  <dt>What is the Public Space Challenge?</dt>
  <dd>
    <p><a href="http://miamifoundation.org/" target="_blank">The Miami Foundation</a>’s Public Space Challenge is a contest open to anyone in Miami-Dade County with an idea for creating, improving or activating their local public spaces. Together with our partners, we invest up to $305,000 to make the top ideas a reality. <a href="https://corporate.target.com/corporate-responsibility/" target="_blank">Target</a> is a partner in the Challenge this year, helping to foster ideas that support thriving communities and a healthy environment.</p>

  <dt>Why public spaces?</dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Vibrant public spaces improve Miamians’ quality of life by serving as a space for healthy lifestyle activities, recreation and civic engagement. They can provide access to the natural beauty and history that South Florida has to offer, and access to artistic and cultural experiences. Public spaces build a stronger sense of community by sparking social engagement between Miamians. </p>
  </dd>

  <dt>What is Miami-Dade County’s Parks & Open Space Master Plan?</dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Miami-Dade County’s Parks & Open Space Master plan was developed with the goal of creating a “seamless, sustainable system of parks, recreation and conservation open spaces for this and future generations.” We see the Public Space Challenge as a way to complement this plan.</p>
    <p>The plan is a connected approach that joins great parks, public spaces, natural and cultural areas, streets, greenways and blueways under a unified mission. There are four major components to the plan:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Parks & Natural Areas</li>
      <li>Greenways & Blueways</li>
      <li>Safe Routes to Parks</li>
      <li>Public Spaces</li>
    </ul>
    <p>You can learn more about the Parks and Open Space Master Plan <a href="http://www.miamidade.gov/parksmasterplan/" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

  <dt>What are public spaces?</dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Public spaces are parks, libraries, public buildings, markets, plazas, playgrounds or any place where people can convene and connect. We also consider access routes, such as bike and walking paths and waterways, as an important part of Greater Miami’s public spaces.</p>
  </dd>

  <dt>How do I know which spaces are public?</dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Don’t worry too much about this when submitting your idea. We want to see everyone's best ideas for improving our community. If your idea is selected as a finalist, we will help with technical assistance to work through any issues.</p>
    <p>If you would like to know the status of a vacant lot or other property in your community, you may check the <a href="http://www.miamidade.gov/pa/property_search.asp" target="_blank">Miami Dade County Property Appraiser’s</a> website. You can search online via their interactive map or call and request the information.</p>
  </dd>

  <dt>Who can submit an idea?</dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Anyone can post ideas: individuals, groups, for-profit companies, nonprofit organizations or government entities.</p>
  </dd>

  <dt>I have an idea, but I’ve never done anything like this before. Will anyone help me get the project done?</dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Yes. If your idea is selected as a winner, you will receive technical support and assistance from The Miami Foundation and our partners. </p>
    <p>If you’re selected as a winner, it’s your responsibility to organize, plan, publicize and implement the project. Our goal is to build momentum and progress in Miami-Dade County through the Public Space Challenge, so we’re looking to fund projects that have a high likelihood of completion.</p>
  </dd>

  <dt>Can I submit more than one idea?</dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Yes. There is no limit to the number of ideas you can submit.</p>
  </dd>

  <dt>What happens once the idea submission phase is over?</dt>
  <dd>
    <p>The idea submission phase closes on Thursday, May 3, 2018. Then, we will select finalists from ideas submitted online, and invite them to submit a full proposal in June. Each finalist will receive help completing a full proposal, including a project budget. Full proposals will be reviewed by a committee of community experts and the final winners will be selected from that group in October.</p>

  </dd>

  <dt>How many winning ideas will be selected?</dt>
  <dd>
    <p>There is no preset number of ideas that will be selected. For reference, there were 21 winning ideas in the 2017 Challenge.</p>
  </dd>

  <dt>How much money do winning ideas receive?</dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Winning ideas will receive a share of up to $305,000. There is no predetermined funding level per idea. Awards will be determined after the finalist phase and will depend on project budgets and available funding. For reference, our 2017 Public Space Challenge grants ranged from $4,000 to $25,000, but may be larger or smaller than that in the future. </p>
  </dd>

  <dt>Can I submit an idea for a project already in progress that has previously received some amount of funding?</dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Yes. The Miami Foundation encourages collaboration. If you are already working on a related project, consider submitting a component of that project to the Public Space Challenge.</p>
