    "description": "Downtown Dadeland is understood as one of Greater Miami\u2019s best examples of a thriving, self-sustaining urban core.  The only critical element missing from this bourgening economic and cultural node is an OPEN GREEN SPACE.  \r\n\r\nIn order to make Downtown Dadeland a true Live, Work and Play community, it must find a venue that would allow local residents to find nearby recreational opportunities they can conveniently engage in.  The connectivity this particular location has to compact development, mixed-use zoning, a diverse population, the Metro Rail, Bus way, M-path and US-1 make this an ideal place to promote sustainable living and effective transit systems, two elements of dire need for the future of Greater Miami.  \r\n\r\nAll elements within the sketch are interchangeable.    These are all just concepts made to provoke thought.  Most of the elements in this sketch are modifications that are not expensive financially, but would require time and commitment to change current land use policies.  \r\n",

    "description": "Miami River Greenway gap closure/\"Pop-up Park\" - This satellite image shows a 300-foot gap in the Miami River Greenway on the north bank next to the Miami Avenue bridge.  This is the only missing privately owned north bank section in the 1.7 miles between the mouth of the river and the NW 5th Street bridge.  Developers are required to build segments of the greenway when they construct their projects, but it is not known when this site will be developed.  Partners such as Rails-to-Trails Conservancy, the Miami River Commission, City of Miami, Miami-Dade County and Miami Downtown Development Authority have been meeting and discussing innovative ways to create a \u201cpop-up park\u201d along this section as part of the Public Space Challenge.  We propose working with partners and the private landowner to provide minimum improvements to the parcel to allow for safe public use and continuity until such time as formal development of the greenway occurs in the future.",
    "details": "Providing public access across the site in advance of building construction would complete the longest waterfront public space outside of the beaches, leverage the millions of dollars that has been invested in other Miami River Greenway sections and allow safe physical activity each day to thousands of residents, workers and visitors for recreation and practical travel.  It is not shown in the satellite picture, but Miami-Dade County Public Works-Waste Management is currently building the segments on publicly owned land under the Miami Ave bridge to the east and under Metrorail to the west.

    "description": "Health in the Hood, along with their community partners, plans to install a pop-up neighborhood gathering place featuring large-scale mural, community garden, and market in a vacant Brownsville lot. This lot, located at NW 27 Avenue and NW 54 Street, has been vacant for decades.  It is an eyesore to residents, as well as a breeding ground for illegal activity, namely profuse littering and an unsanctioned Saturday flea market. A pop-up exhibit in this unused lot will uplift the neighborhood, inspiring change and providing local residents the opportunity to voice their opinions and visions for the future.",
    "details": "Based on conversations held in Fall 2012, local residents are concerned with the current state of this vacant lot and have many ideas for its transformation.  By providing a temporary neighborhood gathering place featuring art & culture, healthy food options, and economic development opportunities, we hope to inspire residents to see the endless possibilities of the vacant lot at NW 27 Avenue and NW 54 Street. \r\n\r\nThe main purpose of the pop-up exhibit is to provide a platform for residents to brainstorm and collaborate on more permanent restoration options.  Drawing inspiration from Candy Chang\u2019s Neighborland, residents can write, draw, speak, and share their ideas for the vacant lot.\r\n\r\nThe mural will serve as a jumping point for positive change in the neighborhood.  Showcasing the community-chosen Brownsville logo and other elements, this will be a conversation piece, a meeting place, and a beautiful entryway to the community.\r\n\r\n The garden and market will provide residents regular access to fresh fruits and vegetables. Health in the Hood will install up to 20 garden plots for Brownsville children and families to increase access to healthy foods and hands-on community gardening.  Our gardens produce kale, collard greens, spinach, tomatoes, okra, swiss chard, eggplant, green beans, mangos, herbs and much more!  In addition to the fresh local produce, the market will also feature local products and goods to stimulate economic development.  By playing a role in the creation of catalytic positive change, children and families build a connection to their neighbors and neighborhood. \r\n\r\nOur vision is for improved wellness in Brownsville with children and families actively participating in their own community\u2019s journey.  By providing community gardens, public art, business opportunities, health education, and community engagement opportunities, Health in the Hood programs are putting children on the path to healthy futures, giving parents helpful information and creating environments that support healthy choices. \r\n\r\nWe hope the creation of a pop-up community gathering space will encourage residents to take steps toward creating positive change.",

    "description": "As part of a larger initiative to make fitness fun, convenient and affordable, Miami-Dade County Parks, Recreation & Open Spaces Department, in partnership with The Trust for Public Land, installed an outdoor Fitness Zone\u00ae at the Gwen Cherry Park.  It was unveiled on the July 24, 2012.   It could be improved by providing  some protection from the sun for those who want to use the area, while providing shade covering that lets sunlight in.",
    "details": "One of the great things about Miami is that there is year-round sunshine and there are lots of outdoor activities.  The Fitness Zone at Gwen Cherry Park creates a great opportunity for youth and the elderly to use the outdoor equipment to stay healthy and fit.  However, it could be better utilized if there was some protection from the South Florida heat.  Sometimes, the sun makes it too hot to touch the metal equipment.\r\nThis issue could be resolved if there was a shade covering for the area.  One suggestion is to provide colorful strips of material, like the ones used on sails, to shade the area while allowing some sunlight in. With shade covering, more seniors will be able to use the Fitness Zone during the day and the youth and their families can use the space in the afternoon and evening.\r\nAlso, the Fitness Zone is near the park\u2019s entrance.  If the shade covering is beautiful and colorful, it could also be used to attract and welcome more children and families to the park.\r\n",

    "description": "ACTIVATING CONNECTIVITY \u2013 A PILOT POP-UP POCKET PARK PROJECT\r\n\r\nOUR VISION & INSPIRATION\r\n\r\nActive, successful, and iconic public spaces from around the world (Federation Square in Melbourne, Australia; Millennium Park in Chicago, Illinois; Yonge-Dundas Square in Toronto, Canada) have many features in common \u2013 access to cultural events and galleries, a breathtaking view, a variety of dining options, and a transportation hub to bring people directly into the space are examples of just a few of the ingredients that create the type of environment which brings a diverse community together.\r\n\r\nDowntown Miami, with the Arts & Entertainment District, its Central Business District, and the waterfront area create the existing foundation for much of these basic venues and services. We have the Adrienne Arsht Center for the Performing Arts, American Airlines Arena, Bayside Marketplace, and Bayfront Park. Also in development are the new Perez Art Museum and the new Miami Visitors Center, the Miami Art Museum and the Miami Science Museum going up in Museum Park (formerly known as Bicentennial Park), and the new FEC passenger station in downtown Miami. All of these elements provide the makings for Miami to have an iconic public space that would otherwise require millions of dollars of capital investment to provide the same amenities.\r\n\r\nRather than creating an entirely new public space, let us use the many great things that already exist in downtown Miami and that are already happening and simply connect them. Connectivity, particularly safe, shaded, and comfortable pedestrian connectivity is one of the main challenges Miami continues to face. Basic improvements such as lining this corridor with native Florida shade trees and activating the public spaces between these many venues will encourage social interaction and pedestrian traffic. \r\n\r\nImagine a Miami where young couple enjoying an afternoon picnic in Bayfront Park, listening to live music from local street performers then decide to walk through a pedestrian walkway along Biscayne Boulevard, fully shaded by Silver Buttonwoods and Gumbo Limbos, all the way up to the Arsht Center to check out what great shows are playing that evening. Along the way, they encounter many other amazing pocket parks where children are playing in the water fountains to stay cool, people are sitting at tables enjoying Cuban coffee and playing chess, and a group of university students are playing salsa music and giving free dance lessons to the public.\r\n",
    "details": "OUR TEAM & PROJECT\r\n\r\nBy activating underutilized public spaces between many of these venues, we can create small pocket parks that make it more inviting and enticing to walk this main corridor and explore its many offerings rather than getting in a car to drive from Point A to Point B and bypassing everything in-between. \r\n\r\nThe US Green Building Council Emerging Professionals (USGBC EPs) and the American Institute of Architects Young Architects Forum (AIA \u2013 YAF) have joined together in a collaborative effort with members from other great community organizations such as the Urban Land Institute (ULI), Tropical Audubon Society (TAS), Environmental Coalition of Miami and the Beaches (EcoMB), Catalyst Miami, County Commissioners offices, and local businesses to create a pilot pop-up park behind the Stephen P. Clark Government Center. Downtown Miami is an area that has been planned and developed time and time again, but often times by one owner, one developer, one agency \u2013 limited collaborative efforts. Our intention was to build a coalition of residents from the community, representing various aspects of our diverse population to give voice to its many members on the most viable and desirable uses of our project space. Catalyst Miami has agreed to connect our group with several other community leaders to discuss how we can engage residents from other areas of Miami and bring them downtown so that it truly becomes a space for many aspects of our diverse cultures and population.\r\n\r\nThe Stephen P. Clark Government Center employs thousands of people and countless more walk through its doors every day. Yet the park space behind this center is severely neglected, having only been known for the sensitive Tent City protest. With a water fountain, sit-able areas, shade trees, and a Metro station nearby, this pocket park has the potential to be a vibrant space for the community if only it had the right programming.\r\n\r\nOur project would be to create a pop-up park installation, similar to that of the Purple Line project, to highlight the various programs and activities that could take place at the park behind Stephen P. Clark Government Center. These ideas could be replicated in other pocket parks along the downtown corridor and in any other space in our Miami community.\r\n\r\nOur focus to program this pocket park is \u201cSeeing the Future,\u201d recognizing that Miami is still a very young city and to create a space where art and science collide, where design and the environment meet, where health and innovation intersect. This pop-up parks aims to showcase to Miami residents the possibilities of what our city, of what our community can be in the near and distant future. We want to highlight Miami\u2019s heritage, the various cultures, aspects of the environment, public health awareness, and education and innovation through art.\r\n\r\nExamples of programming that our group has developed are interactive art projects such as digital graffiti walls, wall shows like that of the New World Symphony, a monthly film series, revamping the water fountain to be solar powered and motion controlled, creating multi-purpose seating areas, creating a life-sized chess game like the Shore Club in Miami Beach, adding more native trees and art sculptures to provide shade and urban canopy, creating artistic living plant walls, adding bicycle racks to encourage alternative transportation, hosting a local farmer\u2019s market, a book market, free public cultural dance lessons (e.g. swing, salsa, rumba), a space for tai chi or yoga, creating a small kickball or soccer field, and local art, music, or street performers.\r\n\r\nA collage of our ideas is shown below and the link below to our wiki-page contains more ideas and details of our space. Our ultimate aim is to start the conversation on how to activate and program pocket parks that will encourage community engagement and social interaction, fostering a more pedestrian-focused, healthy, and sustainable Miami community.\r\n",

    "description": "My idea for this space is to deliver Miami\u2019s robust health and fitness culture directly to adults and children in under-served neighborhoods, by creating The Fitness Caravan. This is one possible location.  On a regular schedule, The Fitness Caravan, a converted school bus, will visit \u201cfitness deserts\u201d in Miami, where health facilities and the funding to support them are lacking.  The Caravan will bring fitness equipment, classes for children and adults, and healthy nutrition.",
    "details": "The Fitness Caravan will let people become healthier in their own communities, at no cost.  Modeled on the free programming at Bayfront Park, The Fitness Caravan will visit each neighborhood on a regularly scheduled day of the week.  Free afternoon and evening classes will include yoga, capoeira, Zumba and Boot Camp.  Healthy activities and programming for children will be offered while parents participate.  Through a cooperative agreement with local Community Supported Agriculture (CSA) providers, The Fitness Caravan will offer healthy food and nutrition education.  Experience demonstrates that, when we share healthy activities and values across our community, Miami residents appreciate, participate, and benefit.",

    "description": "Benches on Brickell Bay- On Brickell Bay Drive there is a BEAUTIFUL walkway along the water, but with no where to sit, read, lounge and linger. My husband and I walk along here, well, he walks, i roll. He pushes me in my wheelchair. I have lived on Brickell for almost 20 years and always wondered why there were no benches on this beautiful path..",
    "details": "This would help make our Miami better by encouraging people to stay outside longer and enjoy the fresh air. Having benches would increase community bonding, engagement and gathering. People seem to linger and hang out more when there are places to sit, they don't feel the need to rush on by. Also, for people with mobility issues, having a place to rest is crucial, so benches would be a godsend for the the disabled. I keep imagining Central Park with all the benches for people watching. With all of the high rises in Brickell, having a little area to hang would increase people getting to know their neighbors.",

Consumer expenditures for groceries in the CBD is $20.5 million, yet there are no grocery stores located in the area forcing residents into their cars. In addition, while Bayfont Park lies just east of the CBD, there is little to no connection between the park and its neighboring residents.  ",
    "details": "\u201cOur Biscayne\u201d endeavors to transform a portion of Biscayne Boulevard into a vibrant space, where friends meet, cultures mix and social exchanges unfold. Our project will utilize two of the median parking lots (lots 2 and 3) along the south section of Biscayne Boulevard between East Flagler and NE 2nd Streets as well as a portion of Bayfront Park. \r\n\r\nEach Saturday, one of the lots will be converted into a farmers market, giving residents access to fresh produce, reconnecting the community and invigorating local economies. The other lot will be utilized as \u201cBe Active Park,\u201d a pop-up park to keep CBD residents active by serving as a meeting place for run and bike clubs, a place to take pets and turning asphalt into art by dancing to the music of local bands.\r\n\r\n\u201cOur Biscayne\u201d will also be connected to Bayfront Park by providing an outdoor lounge where residents can read a book or relax while watching the activities below them at the Farmer\u2019s Market and \u201cBe Active Park.\u201d\r\n\r\n \u201cOur Biscayne\u201d will partner with the DDA and the City of Miami, as well as the Miami Parking Authority, to implement this project.

With any public space, accessibility is a key component to its success. Biscayne Boulevard is easily accessible by car, bicycle, the Metromover, the City of Miami Trolley and Miami-Dade County Metorbus service.\r\n\r\nAs proposers of this project, we have extensive experience working in and with local governments.

The Opa-locka Community Development Corporation (OLCDC) is working together with the South Florida Regional Transportation Authority (SFRTA), City of Opa-locka, Florida Department of Transportation, and artists to ensure that the expanded Tri-Rail station reflects this strategy.  The SFRTA plans to create five new bus bays, solar powered canopies, and charging stations in the new Opa-locka station lot.  Artists, the community, and project team will collaborate on these improvements to create a unique space at the station that celebrates Opa-locka and welcomes visitors to the area.",

It also services connections to Miami-Dade Transit buses, Tri-Rail Shuttle links, and the free Opa-locka city shuttle.  Artist- and community-designed continuous bus canopies, seating, and other elements to enhance the station will allow commuters to learn about the community\u2019s identity as the space will reflect the collaborative effort.  It also allows the community to develop a sense of pride and take ownership of one of their public amenities by involving them in the creative process.",

We plan to create regular music, spoken word, and poetry readings on the steps in front of our building\u2014every Friday afternoon!  Built in 1912, the Old Post Office Building\u2019s east fa\u00e7ade is a perfect setting for outreach into the neighborhood.   New York, New Orleans, Seattle to name of few have wonderful live performers throughout their cities\u2014it makes the experience of traveling through a city on foot special.  And we have a plethora of talented folks in Miami!",

We plan to partner with New World School of the Arts, Miami Dade College, BuskerFest, and the Arts & Business Council to give our fantastic local musicians and entertainers their best an opportunity to share their gifts with downtown.   We hope this will inspire other businesses to do the same and maybe even the City of Miami to create a program for buskers, such as the one in New Orleans or Seattle.  This grant would allow us to pay our entertainers!  ",

Surrounded by tall tropical foliage, Sound Garden endeavors to transform a portion of Bayfront Park into an audio oasis that will invigorate cultural engagement and civic life. Through a hidden solar audio system, a weekly variety of instrumental music will seamlessly fill the listening area. For now it only exists in our mind\u2026but wouldn't it be cool to bring it to life? With your vote it can",

The musical program will highlight our cultural diversity and feature instrumental: Ambient, Bossa Nova, Classical, Flamenco, Jazz, Lounge and World music. Sound Garden will have a space for special acoustic performances, and will also house a small lending library where book swapping can take place. This audio oasis can serve as a sightseeing attraction or a hidden gem for locals.

    "description": "is to create the first truly handicapped accessible beach.  Miami-Dade County touts its beaches, saying that people with disabilities are welcome. In truth, some beaches have wheelchair mats, but they end far short of the main beach area.  We are proposing to create the first fully accessible beach to be located on 76th Street in Miami Beach. A wheelchair mat would extend further into the sand, configured to create a patio landing.  We would purchase special assistive beach chairs and aquatic equipment including adaptive kayaks, wave skis, and flotation devices. The project organizer is the Sabrina Cohen Foundation, a non-profit dedicated to providing a better quality of life for people living with paralysis.",
    "details": "fully enjoy the physical, recreational and spiritual benefits of the beach, including the disabled. This fully accessible beach area would enable disabled people to get onto the sand. People in wheelchairs could hang out in the patio area with their friends, bask under umbrella-topped assistive device beach chairs, roll along the shoreline, and enjoy the spray of the waves. Those with assistance could use the specialized aquatic equipment. Such a beach would foster friendships between able-bodied and disabled people, promote tourism, and serve as a model for other county beaches. This accessible beach could be a stand-alone project or could be part of an adaptive gym project that SCF is discussing with the City of Miami Beach.",

There are NO recycling bins in our parks\u2014the very places where people gather to have BBQs, where they bring bottles and cans by the car load  have no alternative but to throw them away in overfilled trash cans which easily blow over and into our waterways.  Additionally, for those conscientious enough to bring their own bottles, there are no purposefully designed refill stations as I have seen in airports and parks at major cities all over the world.   Let\u2019s add recycle bins and water bottle refill stations to popular parks where people gather and exercise. ",
    "details": "Recycle their waste responsibly and cut down on single use plastics (especially plastic water bottles) by giving them an alternative to trash cans and an option to refill their drinking bottles from stations designed for that purpose. There are a variety of ways to design these so that they are fun (some recycle bins make music when you recycle) or have messages conveying the importance of recycling and reducing waste.  Stations can be designed as a water bottle refill and drinking fountain hybrid with counters that track impact by # plastic bottles saved. Both can be branded ( like the coca cola recycling bins on Lincoln road) or have space for advertising to help defray the costs and scale the project to cover more parks in the future.",

Other activities of interest to the community will include free yoga, artist booths, crafts, performances, and activities and hands-on crafts for kids.

It will have a block-party feel, offering market goers a multitude of experiences both inside and around the grounds and surrounding areas of the BAC.

It sits along the main artery connecting I-95 to Biscayne Boulevard and serves as a main hub for bus riders. Easily seen by thousands and visited by hundreds a day, this median is primed to become an important corner of Little Haiti.\n\nNE2P is joining Miami Mountains Foundation to develop A y \u00ef t i, land of high mountains, an art intervention plan to redesign the Median landscape and incorporate a large-scale, walk- through, polychrome iron sculpture of the beautiful mountains in Haiti by kinetic artist Miguel Prypchan, in memory of victims of the Haiti earthquake. The redesigned Median offers additional comfortable seating and shading in the area for pedestrians, church and park-goers, and bus riders, and provides additional greenery and color in an otherwise overlooked lot.\n\nLike the beautified Toussaint L\u2019ouverture park at NE 62nd St and N.

The trail would be extended into the new area to create a loop with outdoor exercise equipment, water refill station and tree ID signs. Currently, the trail is dilapidated, seldom used and includes several invasive tree species. The expanded park would include a reflection area where students and residents of all ages could come to experience the sounds of nature in this unique oasis.",

Combining the City resources with that of the school district, we can achieve a beautiful greenspace that benefits everyone in the area.

    "description": "The formula for \u2018FoodSpark: Miami\u2019 (FSM) is simple in concept: Public Space + Art + Music + Miami Residents + Food + Conversation. This idea - inspired by an initiative that began in St. Louis, MO last year - is for a monthly event creating spaces open to the public, where diverse groups of people can come together to bond over food & topics of discussion they care about. FSM would also incorporate visual/performance art & music. To launch FSM, we envision starting in a place easily accessible by mass transit and centrally located within Miami-Dade County, such as Museum Park. From there, FSM would partner with organizations in various neighborhoods, and travel to different locations each month in order to reach as many people as possible. ",
    "details": "Miami-Dade County is known for being home to a diverse population of individuals who represent a myriad of racial and ethnic backgrounds; however, too often our diverse community tends to live and work in silos, making it difficult to regularly interact with one another in meaningful ways. \u2018FoodSpark: Miami\u2019 (FSM) is about providing more opportunities for the people of greater Miami to connect in a fun way they wouldn\u2019t usually be able to in public places. Each month, FSM will provide another space fostering new relationships between residents who may have never met each other, as well as cultivating ideas to bridge our culturally-rich neighborhoods together despite our geographic separation.",

It is critical we offer shade to avoid the dangerous effects of sunburn and as a measure for their experience to be cool and enjoyable, especially in the summer months.

They would go to Overtown and perform for the residents of Overtown, usually with out charging or being paid, at local venues or even on the street. \r\n\r\nI propose pop up performances in various venues and street corners that bring the music back and educate today's Miami residents about the rich musical legacies that graced our city in its early days using today's local performers.",

Inspired by Isaac Newton's theory that each primary color correlates to a note on the musical scale, we designed a series of dynamic projections to play on the hotel's wall in synchrony with an original composition streamed live online.  For 5 days everyone will have access to this sensorial narrative from public lookout points throughout the city.  NEWT uses everyday technology to celebrate public art, augmented architecture & transmedia. NEWT will also come alive through compelling programming, including thematic events & activations in local spaces in the district.",

People will be taken on an emotional journey designed to tap specific visual and audio cues through color, light and sound; and will also be mobilized to explore related events, panel discussions and activations taking place in the area.  Based on themes of color and sound; public art and augmented architecture; Downtown Miami\u2019s role in the city\u2019s cultural identity; and the intersection between technology and art, NEWT's programming will enlighten younger and newer audiences. NEWT appeals to audiences across gender, language, race, education, socio-economic status and arts sensitivities.",

Next, is the addition of a bike pump/repair station and covered bike parking to better serve bike commuters. Third, is the installation of public art that celebrates the culture of the surrounding \r\ncommunity to make the station more welcoming to patrons.  \r\n",

Tables will double as game boards for dominoes, chess, etc. Decorating the walkway floor with stripes and milestone markers will invite the community to take laps around the building, furthering the library and city\u2019s goal of empowering the residents of Hialeah to lead healthy lifestyles. The addition of a Free Little Library along with a gathering area will create a portable reading room atmosphere to encourage and provide an opportunity for reading beyond the library doors.",
    "details": "The walkway will repurpose and activate the library\u2019s exterior by creating an area where the community can socialize, relax, exercise, and read. The community will have the freedom to use the space creatively with the added benefit of the library\u2019s Wi-Fi extending to this exterior area. These additions will beautify the library and breathe new life into it. Commuters and the general public will see this new movement surrounding the library and feel invited and more at ease to sit, talk, walk, and relax a spell among their fellow neighbors.",

MDC has their culinary program there. There are several new farm-to-table restaurants planned. And it happens to be one of the most food insecure neighborhoods in Miami. Food is a basic human right.\r\n\r\nGentrification doesn't help everyone. We need new economic development models that won't displace current residents, while allowing for the revitalization to occur. Both are possible, but creating meaningful livelihoods around such basic things as food. This project is a first step in that direction.",

    "description": "Our idea is to improve the M-Path below Metrorail before and after The Underline is built. The Underline has a unique challenge; it limits the use of permanent structures that could provide much-needed shade along the corridor.  We will create a highly visible, annual architectural competition for a temporary shade structure to be added to the MPath/ Underline project. The annual competition will be run through the University of Miami\u2019s School of Architecture; and we will build and install the first selected design.  Our goal is to enhance public open space in the city by creating an iconic structure to be enjoyed by locals and tourists alike.    ",

We are excited to offer a high-profile architectural event that brings attention and purpose to the future Underline while spotlighting design excellence in Miami.  A similar initiative: the Serpentine Gallery Pavilion in Hyde Park, London, is one of the most exciting architectural events in the world. Likewise, The Underline Pavilion competition would be an architectural beacon each year, offering much-needed shade structures for Underline visitors and users.  ",

    "description": "The TOML seeks to transform the Par 3 Golf Course, located on the east side of the Palmetto Expressway and south of NW 154th Street, into Miami Lakes Par 3 Central Park. The 32-acre parcel of land, known as the Par 3 Golf Course, was acquired by the Town through a donation from The Graham Companies. Originally opened in 1963, the 18-hole Par 3 Course is located within prime gathering space of Don Shula\u2019s Resort. Our vision is to convert the Par 3 Course into a multi-use central park. This Idea would benefit the recreationally underserved residential community with a unique gathering space, allowing Miami residents to engage at a momentous golf course transformed into a vibrant central park.",
    "details": "Par 3 Golf Course is surrounded by apartments, condominiums, villas, hotels, and restaurants. Thus, this Park would be an excellent gathering space for Miamians. Proposed amenities and activities for people to enjoy include walking, jogging, biking, bird watching, sunbathing, and hiking; fitness station; kids play area; botanical gardens; butterfly garden; enhanced landscaping; picnic shelters; and a park and ride parking lot for transit. Strong evidence shows, when people have access to parks and contact with the natural world, their physical and psychological health is improved. The availability of parks is an important quality-of-life factor. This Idea would make Miami better by providing vibrant public green and recreational space.",

Therefore, Biscayne Green will provide recreational and passive amenities for residents of all ages and user types, both day and night.   \r\n\r\nWe will work with FDOT, MDC, MPA and the City to acquire the parking bays, as well as design, install, service, secure, break-down, and fund the entire demonstration project for one month (and donate materials thereafter).  The end goal is to showcase the kind of urban environment people desire, prove that there is a demand for these spaces, and generate the continuous momentum to a point where they can be implemented permanently.",

Dubbed MMC by the Sea, the first volume took place in November, 2016, in collaboration with the Common Field national arts convening. For these events, held at the park\u2019s low-cost rental pavilions, artists will be asked to create site-specific sound and performance works, creating a dialogue about the park itself and its future. The series will advocate for responsible environmental stewardship, and will bring greater attention to the park across a diverse community of cultural producers and audiences.",

It will provide a platform for different, critically-engaged communities to come together while encouraging thoughtful meditation on the bridges between culture and nature. The performances will promote responsible use and appreciation for Miami\u2019s parks and beaches, while activating them in ways Miami audiences have rarely seen. MMC by the Sea will offer a site for sonic contemplation and reflection on the natural beauty and history of South Florida, coupled with a lovely day at the beach.\r\n",

The Ciclovia will create a stronger, more aware community rallying together toward shared interests such as promoting other events and improving rider safety.

Honeybees pollinate agricultural and horticultural crops, helping us sustain crops (specifically tropical fruit trees!) while supporting beautiful, flowering landscapes.

Using local Little Haiti artists to help design the mini golf course in Caribbean theme will capitalize on the strong sense of ownership that the Miami community displays in its neighborhoods. This project will enhance the recent activation of the Caribbean Marketplace and the new Mache (traditional Haitian open air market) taking place every Saturday from 10AM-4PM, so Miamians and visitors can enjoy both the project and the cultural events in Little Haiti.",

    "description": "is to use colorful LED lighting to brighten/ beautify the NW 20th Street underpass, making it safer and more appealing for pedestrians and bikers. In this area, I-95 serves as a significant barrier between Wynwood and Overtown; NW 20th Street is one of the few connecting streets, yet the underpass at I-95 is a dark and unpleasant experience for pedestrians. However, with the imminent addition of a CitiBikes stand at Converge Miami and the forthcoming addition of pedestrian crosswalks thanks to a collaboration with Street Plans Collective, this corner will become more transitable and engaging.  Lighting the underpass will encourage more pedestrian activity across these disconnected neighborhoods.",
    "details": "walk along the NW 20th St underpass safely and comfortably, while enjoying a colorful light display. The underpass lighting will help re-connect the communities on either side of I-95 by increasing the flow of pedestrians and bikers through this area who are traveling between home, work, school, health services, recreation and retail destinations. As Converge Miami grows as an entrepreneurial center, more startups, students, and researchers will populate this area. If, however, the streets surrounding the building remain inhospitable to pedestrians, they will remain siloed and be less likely to engage with the neighborhood. The objective of the underpass project is to dovetail with other additions to incentivize walking and biking.",

    "description": "The Miami FC Foundation will transform the underutilized street hockey rink at Tamiami Park into a Mini-Pitch on which small-sided football (soccer) games can be played.\r\n*Small-sided football matches are any played with teams of less than 11 a side.\r\nMini-Pitches have been proven to have a positive impact on recreational participation by giving more people across all categories the opportunity to play the game. Simply put, Mini-Pitches support informal play, making the game accessible to everyone who has an interest, including key target groups who may not feel included - individuals with disabilities, younger age groups, and girls.\r\nThe Mini-Pitch will also be used as a host site for other inclusive health & wellness programming.",
    "details": "As the world's most popular sport, football has the unique opportunity to unite Miami's diverse populace in a way that no other sport can. Football is inclusive by nature. Players don't need special equipment to play; just a ball and a playing field - and we have learned that people are already using the hockey rink for this purpose. \r\nReceiving this grant will allow us to enhance the experience by creating a more safe and welcoming place for an even greater number of people to engage: new relationships will be \r\ndeveloped as people meet and take part in impromptu \"pick-up\" games; use of the Mini-Pitch will inspire activity that reinforces play as a vital component of a healthy lifestyle.",

    "description": "A litle history... the Flagler Cottage is on a City-owned lot deemed Ft. Dallas Park, on the north side of the Miami River in downtown.  The Park is fenced and locked, the historic Flagler Cottage  needs repair and it is off limits to all.  The Flagler Cottage is the only remaining building building that evidences Henry Flagler's existence in Miami - amazing given the fact he basically put Miami on the map by bringing the railroad here!  Through a creative partnership with the City and private companies, Dade Heritage Trust can restore and interpret the building, open it to the public and create a cafe and bike rental shop right on the Miami River Greenway - an awesome and seldom used urban bike and pedestrian trail along the Miami River.",
    "details": "By creating the Flagler Cottage Cafe and Bike Rental, the public will have access to an historic building and greenspace on the Miami River.  Visitors will get to know the Miami River Greenway as part of a transit trail along both banks of the Miami River and be encouraged to use the Greenway via bike or foot.  In addition, the history of the railroad in Miami and Henry Flagler's vast influence on the development Miami could be presented inside the historic Cottage which can also serve as a visitors center with information about Miami. Long-term,  people that also envision the Flagler Cottage property as a water-taxi stop.  So visitors to the site:  learn about history at a restored historic site, learn about an urban trail, bike and walk!",
