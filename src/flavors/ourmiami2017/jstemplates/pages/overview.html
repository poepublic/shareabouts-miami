<p>{{#_}}The Miami Foundation’s Public Space Challenge is back for 2017. We’re investing $305,000 in your ideas to improve Miami’s public spaces. Submissions to this year’s Public Space Challenge open March 7 and close at 11:59PM ET on April 6. Any person or organization can apply with any idea for any part of Miami-Dade County. No idea is too small, too big, or too far.{{/_}}</p>

<p>{{#_}}This year, we’re using the Challenge to help make a bold vision into reality: a great public space within walking distance of every Miamian.{{/_}}</p>

<p>Miami-Dade County’s Department of Parks, Recreation, and Open Spaces is our partner in this year’s contest. Their Parks and Open Space Master Plan shares our goal of a great public space within walking distance of every Miamian. We invite you to take a look at the plan, and think about how your idea might be a part of it. Your ideas and the winning projects will add momentum that can help move the plan forward.</p>

<p>The plan focuses on these four areas:</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Great public spaces</strong> often define the great cities of the world. As Miami Dade County develops more densely, there will be a need for great, attractive, usable public spaces that provide an opportunity for meaningful recreation experiences. </li>
  <li><strong>Great parks, natural and cultural places</strong> are for everyone. The County’s Vision is that residents of every neighborhood, urban, suburban, rural, incorporated and unincorporated, have equal access to places to walk, to exercise, to socialize and to engage in a healthy, active lifestyle.</li>
  <li><strong>Great greenways, trails, and waterways</strong> can form an interconnected system that: provides transportation alternatives and reduces traffic congestion; creates new recreational opportunities; increases property values; protects natural resources; and encourages tourism and business development. </li>
  <li><strong>Great streets</strong> can be created through the redevelopment of existing roads to: create urban form and identity; improve aesthetics; provide for bicycle/pedestrian safety and comfort; and to improve the social, physical and economic environment for land uses. Miami-Dade County must move beyond vehicular performance based street design and instead design streets that are defined by their role in the community.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>The idea submission phase is now closed.</strong></p>
