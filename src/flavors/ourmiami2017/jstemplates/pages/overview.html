<p> <strong>Let’s get a great public space within walking distance of every Miamian.</strong> </p>

<p> The Miami Foundation’s Public Space Challenge is back for 2017. We’re investing $305,000 in your ideas to improve Greater Miami’s parks, plazas and local gathering places. We’re proud to have the support of Target who is contributing to this year’s Challenge for ideas that encourage healthy eating and active play for youth and their families.  Any individual or organization can apply with any idea for any part of Miami-Dade County. No idea is too small, too big or too far. </p>

<p>We picked these categories because they’re part of the <a href="http://www.miamidade.gov/parksmasterplan/" target="_blank">Parks and Open Space Master Plan</a> from Miami-Dade County, who are our partners in this year’s contest.</p>

<p><strong>About the Parks and Open Space Master Plan</strong></p>

<p>The Parks and Open Space Master Plan from Miami-Dade County shares our goal of getting a great public space within walking distance of every Miamian. We invite you take a look at the full plan for inspiration. Your ideas and the winning projects will add momentum that can help move the plan forward. </p>

<p>The plan focuses on these four areas:</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Parks and natural areas.</strong> The county’s vision is that residents of every neighborhood, urban, suburban, rural, incorporated and unincorporated, have equal access to places to walk, exercise,socialize and engage in a healthy, active lifestyle; and access to historic, cultural and natural places preserved for all to enjoy.</li>
  <li><strong>Greenways and blueways</strong> can form an interconnected system that: provides transportation alternatives and reduces traffic congestion, creates new recreational opportunities, increases property values, protects natural resources, and encourages tourism and business development. </li>
  <li><strong>Safe routes to parks</strong> can be created through the redevelopment of existing roads to: create urban form and identity, improve aesthetics, provide for bicycle/pedestrian safety and comfort, and to improve the social, physical and economic environment for land uses. Miami-Dade County must move beyond vehicular performance based street design and instead design streets that are defined by their role in the community. </li>
  <li><strong>Great public spaces</strong> often define the great cities of the world. As Miami-Dade County develops more densely, there will be a need for great, attractive, usable public spaces that provide an opportunity for meaningful recreation experiences. </li>
</ol>
