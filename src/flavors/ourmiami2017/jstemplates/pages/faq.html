  <dt>What is the Public Space Challenge?</dt>
  <dd>
    <p>The Miami Foundation&#39;s Public Space Challenge is a contest open to anyone in Miami-Dade County with an idea for creating, improving or activating their local public spaces. Together with our partners, we invest $305,000 to make the top ideas a reality.</p>
    <p>Target is a partner in the Challenge this year, helping to foster ideas that encourage healthy eating and active play for youth and their families.</p>
  </dd>

  <dt>What&#39;s new in 2017?</dt>
  <dd>
    <p>This year, we&#39;re using the Challenge to help make a bold vision into reality: a great public space within walking distance of every Miamian. That&#39;s also the goal of the Parks and Open Space Master Plan created by Miami-Dade County&#39;s Department of Parks, Recreation and Open Spaces, who are partners in this year&#39;s contest. Your ideas will add momentum by providing short-term projects that can help move the plan forward.  The leaders behind the Open Space Master plan will be looking at the ideas you and your neighbors submit as a way to inform the master plan&#39;s implementation on a block by block basis.</p>
  </dd>

  <dt>What is Miami-Dade County&#39;s Parks &amp; Open Space Master Plan?</dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Miami-Dade County&#39;s Parks &amp; Open Space Master plan was developed with the goal of creating a &ldquo;seamless, sustainable system of parks, recreation and conservation open spaces for this and future generations.&rdquo;</p>
    <p>The plan is a connected approach that joins great parks, public spaces, natural and cultural areas, streets, greenways and blueways under a unified mission. There are four major components to the plan:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Parks &amp; Natural Areas</li>
      <li>Greenways &amp; Blueways</li>
      <li>Safe Routes to Parks</li>
      <li>Public Spaces</li>
    </ul>
    <p>You can learn more about the Parks and Open Space Master Plan at Miami-Dade County&#39;s website.</p>
  </dd>

  <dt>Why public spaces?</dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Vibrant public spaces improve Miamians&#39; quality of life by serving as a space for healthy lifestyle activities, recreation and civic engagement. They can provide access to the natural beauty and history that South Florida has to offer, and access to artistic and cultural experiences.  Public spaces build a stronger sense of community by sparking social engagement between Miamians.</p>
  </dd>

  <dt>What are public spaces?</dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Public spaces are parks, libraries, public buildings, markets, plazas, playgrounds or any place where people can convene and connect. We also consider access routes, such as bike and walking paths and waterways, as an important part of Greater Miami&#39;s public spaces.</p>
  </dd>

  <dt>How do I know which spaces are public?</dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Don&#39;t worry too much about this when submitting your idea. We want to see everyone's best ideas for improving our city. If your idea is selected as a finalist, we will help with technical assistance to work through any issues.</p>
    <p>If you would like to know the status of a vacant lot or other property in your community, you may check the <a href="http://www.miamidade.gov/pa/property_search.asp" target="_blank">Miami Dade County Property Appraiser&#39;s</a> website. You can search online via their interactive map or call and request the information.</p>
  </dd>

  <dt>Who can submit an idea?</dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Anyone can post ideas: individuals, groups, for-profit companies, nonprofit organizations or government entities.</p>
  </dd>

  <dt>Can an idea be submitted by an informal group? (i.e. we are not a registered club, group or organization)?</dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Yes. The Miami Foundation encourages you to form a team around your project that can help you brainstorm, plan and implement your idea.</p>
  </dd>

  <dt>Can I submit more than one idea?</dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Yes. There is no limit to the number of ideas you can submit.</p>
  </dd>

  <dt>Do I have to submit a budget or cost estimate?</dt>
  <dd>
    <p>A budget is not necessary at the time of idea submission. If your idea is selected as a finalist, the Foundation will provide assistance to help you prepare a budget.</p>
  </dd>

  <dt>When will the winners be announced?</dt>
  <dd>
    <p>The idea submission phase closes on Thursday, April 6, 2017 at 11:59 PM. Winners will subsequently be selected and announced in September.</p>
  </dd>

  <dt>What happens once the idea submission phase is over?</dt>
  <dd>
    <p>A group of finalists will be selected in May. Each finalist will receive assistance in completing a full proposal, including a budget. All submitted proposals will be reviewed, and the final winners will be selected from that group.</p>
  </dd>

  <dt>How many winning ideas will be selected?</dt>
  <dd>
    <p>There is no preset number of ideas that will be selected. For reference, there were 19 winning ideas in the 2016 Challenge.</p>
  </dd>

  <dt>How much money do winning ideas receive?</dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Winning ideas will receive a share of $305,000. There is no predetermined funding level per idea. Awards will be determined after the finalist phase and will depend on project budgets and available funding. For reference, our 2016 Public Space Challenge grants ranged from $4,000 to $25,000, but may be larger or smaller than that in the future.</p>
  </dd>

  <dt>How are ideas selected?</dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Winning ideas will be selected by a panel of community experts and placemaking professionals.</p>
  </dd>

  <dt>I have an idea, but I&#39;ve never done anything like this before. Will anyone help me get the project done?</dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Yes. If your idea is selected as a winner, you will receive some technical support and assistance from The Miami Foundation and its partners.</p>
    <p>However, if you&#39;re selected as a winner, it&#39;s your responsibility to organize, plan, publicize and implement the project. Our goal is to build momentum and progress in Miami-Dade County through the Public Space Challenge, so we&#39;re looking to fund projects that have a high likelihood of completion.</p>
  </dd>

  <dt>Can I submit an idea for a project already in progress that has previously received some amount of funding?</dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Yes. The Miami Foundation encourages collaboration. If you are already working on a public-space-related project, consider submitting a component of that project to the Public Space Challenge.</p>
  </dd>

  <dt>Can I start working on my idea before the winners are announced?</dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Yes and you are encouraged to do so. You can start building a team and planning your idea at any point.</p>
  </dd>

  <dt>Is this an arts contest?</dt>
  <dd>
    <p>While creativity and the arts can be an important component of improving public spaces, this is not strictly an arts contest. We encourage all ideas, big or small, that will help make great public spaces in Miami-Dade County.</p>
  </dd>

  <dt>I still have questions. How can I get more information?</dt>
