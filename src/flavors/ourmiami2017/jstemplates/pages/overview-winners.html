<p>The Miami Foundation&#39;s Public Space Challenge is back for 2018. We&#39;re investing up to $305,000 in your ideas to improve Greater Miami&#39;s parks, plazas and local gathering places. Any individual or organization can apply with any idea for any part of Miami-Dade County. No idea is too small or too big.</p>

<p>This year, Target will contribute funding to support winning ideas that encourage healthy eating and active play.</p>

<p>There are four categories in this year&#39;s Challenge:</p>
<ul style="margin-top: -1em;" class="marker-list">
  <li style="background-image: url(/static/css/images/markers/circle-ParksAndNaturalAreas.png);">Parks &amp; Natural Areas</li>
  <li style="background-image: url(/static/css/images/markers/circle-GreenwaysAndBlueways.png);">Greenways &amp; Blueways</li>

  <li style="background-image: url(/static/css/images/markers/circle-PublicSpaces.png);">Public Spaces </li>
</ul>

<p>We picked these categories because they&#39;re part of the <a href="http://www.miamidade.gov/parksmasterplan/" target="_blank">Parks and Open Space Master Plan</a> from Miami-Dade County, who are partners in this year&#39;s contest.</p>

<p><strong>About the Parks and Open Space Master Plan</strong></p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.miamidade.gov/parksmasterplan/" target="_blank">Parks and Open Space Master Plan</a> from Miami-Dade County shares our goal of getting a great public space within walking distance of every Miamian. We invite you take a look at the full plan for inspiration. Your ideas and the winning projects will add momentum that can help move the plan forward.</p>

<p>The county&#39;s vision is that residents of every neighborhood, urban, suburban, rural, incorporated and unincorporated, have equal access to green spaces where they can walk, exercise, socialize and engage in a healthy, active lifestyle.</p>

<p>The plan focuses on these four areas:</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Parks and natural areas.</strong> We should all have access to great green spaces (think parks, fields, recreation centers) where we can hang out, relax, and exercise. We should preserve our county&#39;s historic places and natural areas (think Vizcaya, Fruit &amp; Spice Park, and nature preserves) for everyone to enjoy.</li>
  <li><strong>Greenways and blueways.</strong> We should have spaces that help us get around without our cars, and get us out in nature to explore in new ways (think bike trails, the Underline, the Miami river and Biscayne Bay).</li>
  <li><strong>Safe routes to parks.</strong> We should be able to access our public spaces safely. Whether it&#39;s by road (think sidewalks, crosswalks, and complete streets), walking or biking, or public transportation, the environment surrounding public spaces should be safe for all.</li>
  <li><strong>Great public spaces.</strong> The great cities of the world are defined by their public spaces (think plazas, waterfronts, libraries, street corners and even alleyways). As Miami-Dade County grows, we&#39;ll need innovation everywhere. </li>
</ol>
