<p>{{#_}}Vibrant public spaces help connect Miamians to our community and each other.  The Miami Foundation’s Public Space Challenge uncovers the best ideas for creating, improving and activating parks, plazas and local gathering places.  Together with Health Foundation of South Florida and the Office of Miami-Dade County Commissioner Juan C. Zapata, we invest $305,000 to make the top ideas a reality.{{/_}}</p>

<p>{{#_}}Everyone in Greater Miami – individuals, groups, for-profit companies and nonprofit organizations – can submit an idea.  Help make Miami a more lively, engaged place to live.{{/_}}</p>
