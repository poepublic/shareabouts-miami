<h1>2019 Our Miami Public Space Challenge FAQs</h1>

<dl class="faq">
  <dt>What is the Public Space Challenge?</dt>
  <dd>
    <p>The Public Space Challenge is an ideas contest open to anyone in Miami-Dade County with an idea for creating, improving or activating our local parks and public spaces. This year, we’re looking for your best ideas that make moving around our community easier. Think bus stops, bike lanes, water ways, streets, sidewalks, crosswalks or wayfinding signs. The way you do that is totally up to you!</p>
    <p>Together with our partners, <a href="http://miamifoundation.org/" target="_blank">The Miami Foundation</a> will invest $250,000 to make the top ideas a reality. <a href="https://corporate.target.com/corporate-responsibility/" target="_blank">Target</a> will support ideas that encourage thriving and connected communities.</p>
  </dd>

  <dt>What do you mean by mobility?</dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Think about all the different ways we get around our community - streets, sidewalks, greenways and waterways. Ask yourself what would make it easier, safer or more fun to use.</p>
  </dd>

  <dt>Why the focus on mobility?</dt>
  <dd>
    <p>When it’s easier to move through a city, the more connected residents become to each other and the place they live. The better connected our community, the more resilient we become as a result.</p>
  </dd>

  <dt>How do I know if my idea is feasible?</dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Don’t worry too much about this when submitting your idea. We want to see everyone&#39;s best
      ideas for improving our community. If your idea is selected as a finalist, we’ll help with technical
      assistance to work through any issues.</p>
  </dd>

  <dt>Who can submit an idea?</dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Anyone can post ideas: individuals, groups, for-profit companies, nonprofit organizations or
      government entities.</p>
  </dd>

  <dt>I have an idea, but I’ve never done anything like this before. Will anyone help me get the project done?</dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Yes. If your idea is selected as a winner, you will receive specialized technical support,
      mentorship and assistance from The Miami Foundation and our partners.</p>
    <p>If you’re selected as a winner, it’s your responsibility to organize, plan, publicize and implement
      the project. Our goal is to build momentum and progress in Miami-Dade County through the
      Public Space Challenge, so we’re looking to fund projects that have a high likelihood of
      completion.</p>
  </dd>

  <dt>Can I submit more than one idea?</dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Yes. There is no limit to the number of ideas you can submit.</p>
  </dd>

  <dt>What happens once the idea submission phase is over?</dt>
  <dd>
    <p>The idea submission phase closes on Thursday, May 16, 2019. Then, we will select finalists
      from ideas submitted online, and invite them to submit a full proposal at the end of June. Each
      finalist will receive help completing a full proposal, including a project budget. Full proposals will
      be reviewed by a committee of community experts and the final winners will be selected from
      that group in September.</p>

  </dd>

  <dt>How many winning ideas will be selected?</dt>
  <dd>
    <p>There is no preset number of ideas that will be selected. For reference, there were 22 winning
      ideas in the 2018 Challenge.</p>
  </dd>

  <dt>How much money do winning ideas receive?</dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Winning ideas will receive a share of $250,000. There is no predetermined funding level per
      idea. Awards will be determined after the finalist phase and will depend on project budgets and
      available funding. For reference, our 2018 Public Space Challenge grants ranged from $5,000
      to $20,000, but may be larger or smaller than that in the future.</p>
  </dd>

  <dt>Can I submit an idea for a project already in progress that has previously received some amount of funding?</dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Yes. The Miami Foundation encourages collaboration. If you are already working on a related
      project, consider submitting a component of that project to the Public Space Challenge.</p>
  </dd>
